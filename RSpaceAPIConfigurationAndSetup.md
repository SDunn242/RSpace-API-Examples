## RSpace API configuration and setup

### Introduction

From version 1.40, RSpace can now be accessed through an API. The API should be considered incomplete, provisional and subject to revision. A stable version 1 API is expected in Q1 of 2017.

### Access

To get set up to make an API call, a few conditions must be met:

1. Your sysadmin has set the **api.available** setting to true - this is the default value, so the API should be available unless your sysadmin has turned it off.

2. You have set up an API key in your RSpace profile page. Your API key is confidential and should not be disclosed publicly, as it gives limited access to your account. You can revoke or regenerate your key at any time. All API requests require setting an HTTP header 'apiKeyâ€™.

### API usage limits

The rate of API calls you can make is currently limited, while we evaluate the performance impact of the API. The default rates are as follows:

##### Default Limits per user

* Maximum 15 requests per 15 seconds.
* Maximum 1000 requests per hour.
* Maximum 5000 requests per day.

Please allow at least 100ms between requests.

##### Default Global limits

* Maximum 75 requests per 15 seconds.
* Minimum interval of 25ms between requests

There is no default global limit on number of requests per day or per hour.

If these limits are exceeded, you will receive a 429 TOO\_MANY\_REQUESTS error response.

#### Setting custom usage limits:

You can set custom usage limits for your RSpace installation using the following deploymen properties. Any properties not set will remain as defaults.

**api.user.limit.day** Maximum requests per user per day
**api.user.limit.hour** Maximum requests per user per hour
**api.user.limit.15s** Maximum requests per user per 15s
**api.user.minInterval** Minimum interval between requests

**api.global.limit.day** Maximum total requests per day
**api.global.limit.hour** Maximum total requests per day
**api.global.limit.15s** Maximum total requests per day
**api.global.minInterval** Maximum total requests per day
